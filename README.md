# Touchpad Toggle GNOME Extension

This extension adds a touchpad toggle switch to the system menu.

## Motivation

I created this extension because when I switched from desktop to laptop, I couldn't find anything suitable for my needs (Ubuntu 24.04, Wayland, GNOME 46). I hope it will be useful to others as well.
